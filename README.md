# quick-view-portfolio-site
A natively built, custom made one page portfolio site which displays my work, using front-end code such as HTML, CSS, Foundation, JavaScript, jQuery and jQuery UI. 
This Git Hub repository is just for demonstration purposes to show the code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and does not include external files such as images, font and documents.
